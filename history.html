    <h1>The History Of Eddsworld</h1>
    <p>Eddsworld Is A Series Of Comics And Videos Created By Edd Gould On The 6Th Of June 2003, <br />
        And Is Still Going To This Day.</p>
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>The First Eddsworld Episode Was Called Edd, And Was Released On A Site Named Newgrounds In 2003.<br />
        Not Many People Count This As The <strong>First</strong> Episode, 
        Seeing As Most People Watch Eddsworld Through Youtube.</p>
    <p class="fun-fact">If You Watch Eddsworld On Youtube, Some Of The Older Eddisodes Will Be In A Low Quality. 
        On Newgrounds, They Use The Original Resolution Of The Videos, So If You Want Higher Quality Eddsworld Eddisodes, 
        Watch Them On Newgrounds.</p>
    <p>Eddsworld Continued To Go On For A While, With Many Eddisodes And Comics, 
        And Had A Change To The Character Designs In 2006, Involving Tom's Eyes Being Changed From One Line, 
        To Two Black Dots.</p>

    <h2>Tord Leaving</h2>
    <p>In 2008, Tord Larsson Decided To Leave The Team, Due To Unexplained Reasons. 
        In The Eddisode <strong>25ft Under The Seat</strong>, There Was A Short Opening Scene Depicting Tord Driving Away From The House.</body></p>
    <p>In One Of The Next Eddisodes After That, Specifically <strong>Zanta Claws II</strong>, There Is One Of The First References To Tord After He Leaves.</p>
    <h2>Edd's Death</h2>
    <p>On The Morning Of Sunday The 25th Of March 2012, Edd Gould Passed Away After A 6 Year Long Battle With Cancer.<br/>
        After Passing Away, Edd Left Behind The First Part Of The Space Face Eddisodes.</p>
    <p>Edd Shall Be Missed, As His Legacy Continues To This Day.</p>
    <h2>Eddsworld Legacy</h2>
    <p>As Stated Before, Edd Gould Had Left Behind Only Part Of Space Face. This Eddisode Needed To Be Finished, 
        So They Hired Paul Ter Voorde To Take Over For The Animation. This Period In Time After Edd Passed Away, Was Called The Legacy Era Of Eddsworld.</p>
    <p>During The Legacy Era, The Eddsworld Crew Hired Different Animators To Take Over The Eddisodes, Including: </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="animators">The Smooth And Beautiful Animations Of Anthony Price In <strong>PowerEdd</strong>.</li>
        <li class="animators">The Cartoonish Style Of Sandra Rivers In <strong>Mirror, Mirror</strong>.</li>
        <li class="animators">The Silly Style Of Brandon Turner In <strong>Trick Or Threat</strong>, And <strong>Christmas Eddventure</strong>.</li>
        <li class="animators">And The Bouncy Style Of Cacti Studios In <strong>Saloonatics</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eddsworld Legacy Ended With 'The End', Where Tord Comes Back, To Get His Giant Robot. This Was Where Eddsworld Legacy Ended, And Eddsworld Beyond Begun.</p>
    <h2>Eddsworld Beyond</h2>
    <p>Eddsworld Beyond Is The Current Version Of Eddsworld, And Is Owned By Matt Hargreaves. There Are Only Two Eddsworld Beyond Eddisodes At The Time Of Writing This. 
        Those Eddisodes Being <strong>The Beaster Bunny</strong>, And <strong>Slippery Slope</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Eddsworld Is A Good Show, And I Am Happy That It Is Still Going On To This Day.</p>
