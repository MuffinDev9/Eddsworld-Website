    <h1>The History Of Eddsworld</h1>
    <p>Eddsworld Is A Series Of Comics And Videos Created By Edd Gould On The 6Th Of June 2003, <br />
        And Is Still Going To This Day.</p>
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>The First Eddsworld Episode Was Called Edd, And Was Released On A Site Named Newgrounds In 2003.<br />
        Not Many People Count This As The <strong>First</strong> Episode, 
        Seeing As Most People Watch Eddsworld Through Youtube.</p>
    <p class="fun-fact">If You Watch Eddsworld On Youtube, Some Of The Older Episodes Will Be In A Low Quality. 
        On Newgrounds, They Use The Original Resolution Of The Videos, So If You Want Higher Quality Eddsworld Episodes, 
        Watch Them On Newgrounds.</p>
    <p>Eddsworld Continued To Go On For A While, With Many Episodes And Comics, 
        And Had A Change To The Character Designs In 2006, Involving Tom's Eyes Being Changed From One Line, 
        To Two Black Dots.</p>

    <h2>Tord Leaving</h2>
    <p>In 2008, Tord Larsson Decided To Leave The Team, Due To Unexplained Reasons. 
        In The Eddisode <strong>25ft Under The Seat</strong>, There Was A Short Opening Scene Depicting Tord Driving Away From The House.</body></p>
    <p>In One Of The Next Episodes After That, Specifically <strong>Zanta Claws II</strong>, There Is One Of The First References To Tord, 
    After He Leaves.</p>
