    <h1>The History Of Eddsworld</h1>
    <p>Eddsworld Is A Series Of Comics And Videos Created By Edd Gould On The 6Th Of June 2003, <br />
        And Is Still Going To This Day.</p>
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>The First Eddsworld Episode Was Called Edd, And Was Released On A Site Named Newgrounds In 2003.<br />
        Not Many People Count This As The <strong>First</strong> Episode, 
        Seeing As Most People Watch Eddsworld Through Youtube.</p>
    <p class="fun-fact">If You Watch Eddsworld On Youtube, Some Of The Older Episodes Will Be In A Low Quality. 
        On Newgrounds, They Use The Original Resolution Of The Videos, So If You Want Higher Quality Eddsworld Episodes, 
        Watch Them On Newgrounds.</p>
